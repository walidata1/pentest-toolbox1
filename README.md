## 1. Subdomain finder with report generating
### Description:
The subdomain_finder script is designed to discover subdomains for a specified main domain. It uses a wordlist (top5.txt) to generate potential subdomains and then attempts to access each subdomain. Discovered subdomains with a successful HTTP response (status code 200) are printed, and a report is generated in .txt format.
```bash
cd ~

cd ./pentest-toolbox1/1.subdomain_finder

./subdomain_finder.py
```
## 2. Port scanner
### Description:
The port_scanner script is a simple tool designed to scan a range of ports on a specified IP address. It prompts the user to enter the IP address to scan, as well as the starting and ending port numbers of the range. The script then scans each port in the specified range and outputs whether the port is open or closed.
```bash
cd ~

cd ./pentest-toolbox1/2.port_scanner

./port_scanner.py
```

## 3. Api consumer
### Description:
The api_consumer script sends a GET request to the Nationalize API, allowing users to input a name. The script fetches data from the API and displays the likelihood percentages of the given name originating from different countries.

```bash
cd ~

cd ./pentest-toolbox1/3.api_consumer

./api_consumer.py
```
## 4. Password cracker
### Description:
The password_cracker script is designed to crack a hashed password using a provided wordlist. The user is prompted to enter the hashed code and the hash type (e.g., md5, sha256). The script then attempts to crack the hash by comparing it against the password guesses from the wordlist. If a match is found, the corresponding password is returned. If no match is found, a message indicating that the password is not in the wordlist is displayed.

```bash
cd ~

cd ./pentest-toolbox1/4.password_cracker

./password_cracker.py
```

## 5. Mac address changer
### Description:
The mac_address_changer script is designed to change the MAC address of a specified network interface. It allows users to choose between different MAC address options: the default MAC address (00:11:22:33:44:55) or three randomly generated MAC addresses. Users can select their preferred option by entering the corresponding number. The script then changes the MAC address of the specified network interface accordingly.

```bash
cd ~

cd ./pentest-toolbox1/5.mac_address_changer

./mac_address_changer.py
```
